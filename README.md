# Thesis_code

The code contain both the code to transmite only random number which was the first experiment and the code to transmit frame. the transmission is done first over TSN, then over 4G and the last part is to join both over TSN and 4G to have a unified network

# Things you will see in the codes

1. Plots -> it has all the plots for the video frame transmite

2. random_num_code -> This has all the code for the first experiment which was base on the random number generation

3. ra_ndom_num_data -> This has all the data for the random number generation

4. realtime_data -> This contain all the data for real time

5. video_frame_code -> This has the code for the last experiment which invlved video frame

6. nonRealTime_data -> has the non real time video frame data
